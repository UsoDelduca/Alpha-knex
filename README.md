This is my personal project. 
The idea is to use user input and save it to a database using routes, servers and a middleware to "talk to" SQLite3

The packages include:

 - Express
 - Knex
 - SQLite3
 - Express Handlebars
 - body-parser
 - Jest
 - nodemon

### Installation

```
npm install
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed:run
npm run dev
```

Be sure to check out the other npm scripts too.
